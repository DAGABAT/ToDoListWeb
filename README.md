This project allows the user to create a simple To Do List, usign the browser storage to keep the tasks saved even the browser is closed and reopened.
NOTE: This porject is not a responsive one, because it pretends be used in a desktop enviroment.

In this exercise I'm applying concepts over the use of the local Storage through the use of JavaScript.

Hope enjoy it!!!!!
